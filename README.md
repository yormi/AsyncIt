# AsyncIt

My quest to make integration-system-functional test with React easy. Hopefully it'll make sense for
someone !

# /!\ Construction Zone /!\

## Possible with the great work behind:

* mocha
* unexpected-react
* react-component-errors
* jsdom
* React and its test-util (dah !)

## Feedbacks... Contributions...

Highly appreciated ! I'm unfortunately not perfect yet.

For pull request,
Just make sure to add tests with your work.
Oh, oh ! Why not `npm run lint` as well :)

## Todo

* Tests for waitOnRoute
* polyfill !?
